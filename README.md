Scratch uses its own programming language, developed by the MIT Media Lab team to be visual and easy to learn. Although this programming language is not based on any common textual programming language, it is designed to introduce users to many fundamental programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions and others. As a result, Scratch is an excellent tool for teaching programming to beginners.

Blocks in Scratch are organized into categories, each representing a type of command or action that can be performed. For example, the most common categories include "Motion", "Appearance", "Sound", "Pen" and "Control". Within each category are a series of blocks representing specific actions that can be performed.

Scratch also provides features to allow users to create their own custom blocks using a visual programming language called "Defining Blocks". This allows users to create custom blocks that perform various actions that can be reused in other programs.

See you later!
